this project is all about html and css. 
its been great to actually understand the difference between html and css as it provides such a fundamental distinction between what the different languages are for.
html is hypertext markup language is basically the language in which you enter the content you wish to display on the web. 
CSS is more about the design and look. move this to the left a little. change this color etc.
